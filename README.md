BugMeBack
============

BugMeBack is a free GNU/GPL Google Chrome extension that allows your users to report bugs with a form that :
* ask all the elements to reproduce and understand the bug
* give the user agent, screen size and url of the bug
* takes a screenshot of the page

Finally, the user can send the bug :
* by copy/pasting the bug report in a mail
* automaticaly with a POST request containing a JSon report when the page contains this kind of meta tag : `<meta name="bugreport" content="https://app.ecogom.fr.ewk/bug.dat" />`

Hope you'll find it usefull, feel free to commit (especially if you want to translate it in your language), suggest improvement or claim issues.
